# encryptor
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/encryptor



A simple GUI application to encrypt and decrypt files with various encryption algorithms.

Encryptor is a simple yet useful encryption and decryption application. Currently Encryptor is in a very early stage. This doesn't mean it doesn't work, but only means not very much encryption and decryption algorithms are available. More algorithms will be added soon!

Encryptor supports the following algorithms: * XOR encryption * Caesar * Vigen√®re

Algorithms we're currently working on: * TEA * RC4

For developers: Encryptor is written in C++ using the Qt framework.
